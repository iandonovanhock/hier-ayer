## Background

Social media allows us to connect with far-away friends and family. But the messages, photos, and videos we share are usually uploaded without any geographic information. We developed this application to provide this missing context to our digital memories. 

## Features

+ Flexible and customized dynamic maps power by MapBox.
+ Implements the Devise gem for secure user authentication 
+ Real-time feed of social activity on the site powered by PubNub. 
+ Instagram integration for authentication and to allow users to import photos.
+ PostgresSQL database with a JSON-data column.
+ Bootstrap for a responsive and modular design.
